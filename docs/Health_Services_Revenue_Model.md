## 💡 Strategic Considerations

### Why Health Services is Strategic

**1. Lower Barrier to Entry**
- $3 net revenue = ~$15-20 gross price point
- More affordable than $5.99-14.99 Assistance plans
- Healthcare = universal need (easier sell)
- Gateway to upsell Assistance

**2. Stickier Product**
- Healthcare = essential service
- Lower churn (5-6% vs 7-8%)
- Higher LTV
- Recurring usage (not just benefits)

**3. Massive TAM**
- All 660k accounts are potential users
- Not just active card users
- Broader demographic appeal
- Underserved market (Latino healthcare)

**4. Cross-Sell Engine**
- Health users → Assistance (20% conversion)
- Assistance users → Health (30% conversion)
- Bundling opportunities
- Higher total LTV

**5. Social Impact**
- Improve healthcare access
- Serve underbanked Latino community
- Mission-aligned with My Bambu
- Strong brand value

**Risk 3: Higher Costs**
- **Scenario**: Need $120k/mo vs $85k/mo in operations
- **Impact**: Profit margin drops from 43% to 28%
- **Mitigation**: Still profitable, optimize costs over time
- **Contingency**: Increase gross price or reduce service scope

**Risk 4: Competitive Entry**
- **Scenario**: Competitor launches similar service
- **Impact**: Slower growth, pricing pressure
- **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, brand trust, integrated offering
