## 💼 NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Negotiate with TransNetwork (Primary Focus)

**Your Position:**
- You're bringing 57,463 monthly transactions (potential)
- High-volume remittance business
- Ready to commit long-term if pricing is right

**Negotiation Points:**

1. **Volume Discount Tiers**
   ```
   Current pricing: $0.80-$3.85 per transaction
   Request tiered pricing:
   - 0-10K transactions/month: Current rates
   - 10K-30K transactions/month: -10% discount
   - 30K-50K transactions/month: -15% discount
   - 50K+ transactions/month: -20% discount
   ```

2. **Blended Rate Proposal**
   ```
   Current average: $2.41 per transaction
   Propose: $2.00 flat rate for all countries (17% discount)
   Your volume: 57K × $0.41 savings = $23,370/month savings for them to consider
   ```

3. **Commitment-Based Pricing**
   ```
   Offer: 2-year contract commitment
   Request: 25% discount on all rates
   Example: Mexico SPEI $0.80 → $0.60
            Nicaragua account $1.50 → $1.13
   ```

4. **Add-on Services Bundling**
   ```
   Request: Free API integration + dedicated support
   In exchange for: Exclusive partnership in your market segment
   ```

### Phase 2: Negotiate with Uniteller (Retention for Exclusive Markets)

**Your Position:**
- You're reducing volume significantly (switching 70% to TransNetwork)
- You only need Uniteller for exclusive countries (Argentina, Chile, Haiti, Uruguay, Paraguay)
- You have leverage: they'll lose most business if they don't negotiate

**Negotiation Points:**

1. **Volume Reality Check**
   ```
   Old volume: 57,463 monthly transactions
   New volume (exclusive countries only): ~15,000 transactions (26% of previous)

   Proposal: "We're switching most traffic to TransNetwork.
             To keep our business in exclusive markets, we need better pricing."
   ```

2. **Match TransNetwork Pricing Where Possible**
   ```
   Current Uniteller: $3.72 average
   Request match: $2.41 average (TransNetwork rate)
   Compromise target: $3.00 average (-19% discount)
   ```

3. **Country-Specific Discounts**
   ```
   Argentina: $4.00 → Request $3.20 (-20%)
   Chile: $4.00 → Request $3.20 (-20%)
   Costa Rica: $4.50 → Request $3.50 (-22%)
   Brazil: $4.00 → NOT NEEDED (switching to TN)
   ```

4. **Minimum Volume Commitment (Use as Leverage)**
   ```
   Offer: "We'll guarantee 12,000 transactions/month in exclusive markets"
   Request: Flat $3.00 rate for all exclusive countries
   Savings: $0.72 per transaction × 12K = $8,640/month
   ```

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEGOTIATION TALKING POINTS

### Meeting with TransNetwork

**Opening:**
> "We're currently processing 57,000+ monthly remittance transactions through Uniteller at an average cost of $3.72 per transaction. We've analyzed your network and see significant value in switching 70% of our volume to TransNetwork. We'd like to discuss volume-based pricing for a long-term partnership."

---

### Meeting with Uniteller

**Opening:**
> "We've completed a competitive analysis and found that TransNetwork offers 35% lower pricing for most corridors. However, we value your exclusive coverage in Argentina, Chile, and other markets. We'd like to restructure our partnership to focus on these exclusive corridors at competitive rates."
