## 🎯 Campaign Best Practices

### Email Best Practices

1. **Personalization**:
   - Use first name
   - Reference last activity
   - Show personalized savings amount
   - Mention specific features they used

2. **Subject Line Optimization**:
   - A/B test every send
   - Use numbers ($89, 14 days)
   - Create urgency (Last chance, Expires)
   - Ask questions (Are you still...?)

3. **Timing**:
   - Tuesday-Thursday: 10am-2pm (highest open rates)
   - Avoid Mondays and Fridays
   - Test evening sends (6-8pm) for working professionals

4. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - 70% of emails opened on mobile
   - Short subject lines (<50 characters)
   - Large CTA buttons
   - Simple, scannable content

### SMS Best Practices

1. **Keep It Short**:
   - <160 characters ideal
   - One clear CTA
   - Use emojis sparingly (1-2 max)
   - Include name for personalization

2. **Timing**:
   - Tuesday-Thursday: 12pm-6pm
   - Avoid early morning (<10am) and late evening (>8pm)
   - Never on Sundays

3. **Opt-Out**:
   - Always include "Reply STOP to opt out"
   - Honor opt-outs immediately
   - Limit frequency (max 2/week)

### Push Notification Best Practices

1. **Relevance**:

2. **Conditional Rewards**:
   - Must complete action (start trial, activate card)
   - Time-limited (use within 30 days)
   - Trackable (unique codes)

## 💡 Advanced Strategies

### Strategy 1: Triggered Reactivation

**Concept**: Automatically trigger campaigns based on specific behaviors

**Triggers**:
1. **Dormancy Milestone**: Day 30, 60, 90 of inactivity
2. **Card Expiration**: When Bambu card is about to expire
3. **Competitive Action**: User signs up for competitor
4. **Life Event**: Birthday, moved to new city, etc.
5. **Product Update**: New feature that matches their past behavior

**Expected Lift**: +15-20% vs batch campaigns

### Strategy 2: Cohort-Based Campaigns

**Concept**: Target users based on signup cohort characteristics

**Cohorts**:
1. **Signup Channel**: Organic vs paid vs referral
2. **Initial Usage**: High vs low engagement in first 30 days
3. **Demographics**: Age, location, income bracket
4. **Device Type**: iOS vs Android vs Web

**Expected Lift**: +20-30% vs one-size-fits-all

### Strategy 3: Win-Back Ladder

**Concept**: Progressively stronger offers for each non-response

**Ladder**:
1. **Touch 1**: Standard 7-day trial
2. **Touch 2**: Extended 14-day trial
3. **Touch 3**: 14-day trial + $10 credit
4. **Touch 4**: 21-day trial + $20 credit
5. **Touch 5**: 30-day trial + $25 credit (final offer)

**Rule**: Each touch only goes to non-responders of previous touch

**Expected Lift**: +25-35% vs single-offer campaigns

### Strategy 4: Referral Reactivation

**Concept**: Use active users to bring back dormant friends

**Mechanism**:
1. Active user refers dormant friend
2. Both get $15 credit if friend reactivates
3. Double incentive drives action

**Expected Reactivation**: 5-10% of dormant base

### Strategy 5: Content-Led Reactivation

**Concept**: Provide value first, sell second

**Content Types**:
1. **Financial Tips**: "5 ways to save on healthcare"
2. **Product Guides**: "How to maximize your Bambu benefits"
3. **Success Stories**: "How Maria saved $200/month"
4. **Industry News**: "New telehealth regulations"

**Sequence**:
- Email 1-3: Pure content, no sales pitch
- Email 4: Soft intro to trial
- Email 5: Direct trial offer

**Expected Lift**: +10-15% vs direct sales approach
