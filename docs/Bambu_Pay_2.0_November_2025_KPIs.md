## 🔍 APPENDIX: PRODUCT CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### IMT Revenue Formula
```
IMT Revenue = Total Deposits × 27% × $0.10
```

**Example (November 2025):**
```
$7,019,219.35 × 27% = $1,895,189.22
$1,895,189.22 × $0.10 = $189,518.92
```

### Card Revenue Formula
```
Card Revenue = Total Deposits × 50% × $0.01
```

**Example (November 2025):**
```
$7,019,219.35 × 50% = $3,509,609.68
