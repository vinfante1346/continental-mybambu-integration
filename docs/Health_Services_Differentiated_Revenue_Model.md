## 📊 Executive Summary

### Why Different Net Revenue by Segment?

Each customer segment has different characteristics that affect their value:

**Always Active Customers**:
- Already engaged and paying
- Higher service utilization
- Premium willingness-to-pay
- Lower incentives needed
- **Higher net revenue potential**

**Dormant Customers**:
- Need reactivation incentives
- Moderate service utilization
- Price-sensitive (why they left)
- Require discounts to return
- **Medium net revenue potential**

**Inactive Customers**:
- Never transacted = lowest intent
- Lowest service utilization expected
- Highest incentives needed
- Steeper discounts required
- **Lower net revenue potential**

## 💰 Differentiated Net Revenue Assumptions

### Segment-Specific Economics

| Segment | Gross Price | Incentives/Discounts | COGS | **Net Revenue** | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Always Active** | $25/month | -$2 (10% discount) | -$19 | **$4.00/month** | Premium users, high usage, full-price |
| **Dormant** | $20/month | -$5 (25% discount) | -$13 | **$2.50/month** | Need incentives, medium usage, discounted |
| **Inactive** | $15/month | -$7 (50% discount) | -$10 | **$1.50/month** | Steep discounts, low usage, intro pricing |

### Why These Numbers Make Sense

**Always Active ($4 net)**:
- Gross price: $25/month (telehealth + prescriptions + wellness)
- Small discount: $2 (existing customer loyalty)
- COGS: $19 (higher usage = higher costs but economies of scale)
- **Net: $4.00** (16% margin on gross)
- These users maximize value and need minimal incentives

**Dormant ($2.50 net)**:
- Gross price: $20/month (core telehealth + prescriptions)
- Medium discount: $5 (win-back offer "25% off to return")
- COGS: $13 (moderate usage expected)
- **Net: $2.50** (12.5% margin on gross)
- Need incentives but will use service moderately

**Inactive ($1.50 net)**:
- Gross price: $15/month (basic telehealth only)
- Heavy discount: $7 ("50% off for 6 months to try us")
- COGS: $10 (low usage expected, cherry-pick benefits)
- **Net: $1.50** (10% margin on gross)
- Breaking even almost, but gets them in the door

---

## 💡 Strategic Insights by Segment

### Insight 1: Always Active Drives 55% of Revenue with 39% of Users

**The Math**:
- 7,263 users @ $4/mo = $29,052 MRR (55% of total)
- 8,079 users @ $2.50/mo = $20,198 MRR (38% of total)
- 3,150 users @ $1.50/mo = $4,725 MRR (7% of total)

**Implication**: Focus on Always Active for maximum revenue impact

**Action**: Allocate 50% of budget to Always Active (up from 40%)

---

### Insight 2: Dormant Provides Volume but at Lower ARPU

**The Math**:
- 268k available vs 112k Always Active (2.4x larger)
- 5% conversion (vs 10% Always) = 13,400 users
- But $2.50 net (vs $4) = 37.5% lower revenue per user

**Implication**: Need volume to compensate for lower ARPU

**Action**: Aggressive reactivation campaigns justified by scale

---

### Insight 3: Inactive Economics Are Marginal

**The Math**:
- $1.50 net revenue × 14.3 months = $21 LTV
- $12 CAC = 1.75:1 ratio (vs 3:1 industry standard)
- 220k available but 2.5% conversion = only 5,500 users

**Implication**: Barely profitable, high risk

**Action**:
- Test with small budget (10-15%)
- If LTV doesn't improve to $25+, cut spending
- Focus on card activation (might improve economics)

## 🎯 Revised Budget Allocation Based on Differentiated Model

### Original vs Optimized Budget Split

| Segment | Original % | Optimized % | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Always Active** | 40% | **50%** | Higher net revenue ($4 vs $2.50/$1.50) |
| **Dormant** | 45% | **40%** | Good volume but lower ARPU |
| **Inactive** | 15% | **10%** | Marginal economics, test only |

### Optimized Budget Allocation (Realistic Scenario)

**Total Acquisition Budget**: $175,000

| Segment | Budget | CAC | Expected Users | MRR Contribution | ROI |
|---------|--------|-----|----------------|------------------|-----|
| **Always Active** | $87,500 (50%) | $3 | 29,167 attempts → 2,917 users | $11,668 | 26.7:1 LTV:CAC |
| **Dormant** | $70,000 (40%) | $7 | 10,000 attempts → 500 users | $1,250 | 6.0:1 LTV:CAC |
| **Inactive** | $17,500 (10%) | $12 | 1,458 attempts → 36 users | $54 | 1.75:1 LTV:CAC |

**Wait, let me recalculate this more accurately...**

### Corrected Budget Allocation

**Total Acquisition Budget**: $193,400 (to acquire 18,492 users over 12 months)

| Segment | Budget % | Budget $ | Target Users | CAC | Total CAC Spend |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Always Active** | 50% | $96,700 | 7,263 | $3 | $21,789 |
| **Dormant** | 40% | $77,360 | 8,079 | $7 | $56,553 |
| **Inactive** | 10% | $19,340 | 3,150 | $12 | $37,800 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$193,400** | **18,492** | **Blended $6.28** | **$116,142** |

**Note**: Budget also covers campaign costs (creative, email, SMS, etc.) beyond pure CAC

## 📊 Sensitivity Analysis - Differentiated Model

### Impact of Net Revenue Changes

**What if Always Active pays more? ($4 → $5 net)**

| Metric | Baseline ($4) | Increased ($5) | Impact |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Month 12 Users | 7,263 | 7,263 | No change |
| Always Active MRR | $29,052 | $36,315 | +$7,263 |
| Total MRR | $52,500 | $59,763 | +13.8% |
| Total ARR | $630,000 | $717,156 | +$87,156 |

**Implication**: Every $1 increase in Always Active net revenue = +$87k ARR

---

**What if Dormant retention improves? (6% → 5% churn)**

| Metric | Baseline (6%) | Improved (5%) | Impact |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Month 12 Dormant Users | 8,079 | 8,847 | +768 users |
| Dormant MRR | $20,198 | $22,118 | +$1,920 |
| Total ARR | $630,000 | $653,040 | +$23,040 |

**Implication**: 1% churn reduction in Dormant segment = +$23k ARR

---

**What if Inactive LTV improves to justify higher CAC?**

Current: $1.50 net × 14.3 mo = $21 LTV, $12 CAC = 1.75:1 ratio

**Option A: Reduce churn** (7% → 5%)
- New lifetime: 20 months
- New LTV: $1.50 × 20 = $30
- New ratio: 2.5:1 ✅ (acceptable)

**Option B: Increase net revenue** ($1.50 → $2.00)
- New LTV: $2.00 × 14.3 = $28.60
- New ratio: 2.38:1 ✅ (acceptable)

**Recommendation**: Test both approaches on Inactive segment
