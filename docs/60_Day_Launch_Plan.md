## 💰 SELLING STRATEGIES & TACTICS

### Tactic 1: Consultative Selling Approach

**For Personal Calls to High-Value Customers**

**Call Structure (10-15 minutes):**

**1. Introduction (2 min)**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Agent] from My Bambu. I'm calling because
you're one of our valued customers, and we've launched something
new that I think could really help your family. Do you have a few
minutes to chat?"
```

**2. Discovery Questions (3 min)**
```
- "Tell me about your family - do you have loved ones back in [Country]?"
- "How often do you send remittances to support them?"
- "Have you ever worried about what would happen if something
  unexpected occurred?"
- "Does your family have easy access to healthcare?"
```

**3. Tailored Solution (3 min)**
```
Based on responses, present relevant plan:

HIGH-VALUE SCRIPT:
"Based on what you've shared, I'd recommend our Advanced+ plan.
Here's why: You're supporting [X people] back home, and if something
happened to you, they'd be taken care of. Plus, your [mom/dad] can
see a doctor anytime from their phone - included."
```

**4. Objection Handling (3 min)**

**Objection: "It's too expensive"**
```
"I understand. Let me break it down: You send about $300/month
to support your family, right? This is $15/month - that's 5% of
what you already send. And it covers $10,000 in funeral costs,
which would otherwise cost you 30+ months of remittances. Plus,
one emergency doctor visit pays for the entire year."
```

**Objection: "I need to think about it"**
```
"Totally understand. Here's what I suggest: try it free for 7 days.
No credit card required. If you don't see the value, cancel anytime.
Plus, I'll add a $10 bonus to your account just for trying. Can I
set that up for you right now?"
```

**Objection: "I already have insurance"**
```
"That's great! This isn't insurance though - it's assistance. It
works alongside your insurance. For example, does your insurance
cover repatriation to [Country]? Does it give your family in [Country]
access to doctors? This fills those gaps."
```

**5. Close (2 min)**
```
"Here's what I'll do: I'll enroll you in the free trial right now.
You'll get an email with all the details. Try it for 7 days, book
a telehealth session, test it out. If you love it - which I think
you will - you're all set. If not, cancel anytime. Sound good?"
```

**6. Follow-up**
```
"Perfect! I'm sending the confirmation now. I'll also send you my
direct number - if you or your family have any questions during the
trial, just text me. We're here to help."
```

**KPIs:**
- Call connection rate: 60%+
- Call-to-trial conversion: 25%+
- Trial-to-paid conversion: 50%+

---

### Tactic 2: "Show Me the Money" ROI Approach

**For Budget-Conscious Medium/Low Segments**

**Email/SMS Script:**

**Subject: "You'll save $1,642 this year with this plan"**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: What would you do with an extra $1,642?

That's how much the average My Bambu customer saves in their
first year with Continental Assist:

💰 Avoided Costs:
- Emergency medical visit: $150 (saved 6x) = $900
- Prescription drug costs: $240/year savings
- Mental health support: $200/session (saved 3x) = $600
- Nutrition counseling: $150/session (saved 4x) = $600
- Total avoided costs: $2,340/year

📉 Your Investment:
- Continental Assist: $96/year (Intermediate plan @ $7.99/mo)

💵 Net Savings: $2,244/year

And that's BEFORE counting the $10,000 funeral coverage,
which alone is worth $10,000 in peace of mind.

P.S. First month 50% off = $4 to try. That's less than a coffee.
```

### Tactic 3: "Social Proof Avalanche"

**For Skeptical/Inactive Segments**

**Multi-Channel Strategy:**

**Email:**
```
Subject: "4,327 My Bambu families are now protected. Are you?"

[NAME], when we launched Continental Assist 30 days ago,
I wasn't sure how it would go.

But the response has been incredible:
- 4,327 families enrolled
- 98% satisfaction rate
- 847 telehealth sessions completed
- $2.1M in coverage now active

Here's what customers are saying:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Saved me $600 already!" - Maria G.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "My mom loves the telehealth" - Carlos R.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Peace of mind is priceless" - Ana M.

Don't be the last to protect your family.

**In-App Banner:**
```
"4,327 families protected ✓
Join them: Try free for 7 days →"
```

**SMS:**
```
[Name], 4,327 My Bambu families joined in 30 days.
See why: [link]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Herd mentality (FOMO)
- Real numbers = credibility
- Testimonials = trust
- Urgency through popularity
- Reduces perceived risk

### Tactic 4: "The Downsell Strategy"

**For Price-Sensitive Prospects Who Don't Convert**

**Trigger:** User views Advanced+ but doesn't enroll within 24 hours

**Email Sequence:**

**Email 1 (24 hours later):**
```
Subject: "Still thinking? Try our most popular plan instead"

Hi [Name],

I noticed you were checking out our Advanced+ plan ($14.99).

That's our premium option, but 67% of customers actually
choose our Advanced plan ($9.99) instead.

Here's what you still get:
✓ $10,000 funeral repatriation
✓ 24/7 telehealth (you + family)
✓ $2,000 funeral assistance
✓ $900 family support
✓ Nutrition & psychology sessions

You only miss: Higher funeral assistance ($2K vs $10K)

Save $5/month, still get 90% of the benefits.

Try Advanced free for 7 days →

[Start Free Trial]

P.S. You can always upgrade later.
```

**Email 2 (48 hours later):**
```
Subject: "What about $7.99/month?"

[Name],

Still on the fence? I get it.

What if I told you that you can get 24/7 telehealth for
your entire family for just $7.99/month?

Our Intermediate plan includes:
✓ $10,000 funeral repatriation
✓ Unlimited telehealth (you + family)
✓ Prescription discounts

That's it. Simple. Affordable. Still amazing.

Try Intermediate free for 7 days →

[Start Free Trial]

P.S. That's $2/week. You spend more on coffee.
```

**Email 3 (72 hours later):**
```
Subject: "Okay, let's start at $5.99"

[Name],

Last offer, I promise.

Our Basic plan is $5.99/month. That's it.

You get:
✓ $10,000 funeral repatriation coverage
✓ Prescription drug discounts

No telehealth, no extra benefits. Just the essentials.

But here's the thing: even at $5.99, you're covered for
the biggest risk - unexpected death and repatriation costs.

That alone is worth it.

[Start Free Trial - $5.99/mo]

- [Agent Name]

P.S. This is the last email. Decision time.
```

**Why It Works:**
- Removes price barrier progressively
- Multiple conversion opportunities
- Demonstrates plan flexibility
- Psychological pricing technique
- Last chance urgency

### Tactic 5: "The Trial Rescue Mission"

**For Users Who Start Trial But Don't Engage**

**Trigger:** Trial user hasn't logged in for 3+ days

**Day 3 of Inactivity:**

**SMS:**
```
Hi [Name]! I noticed you started your trial but haven't
explored the benefits yet. Need help? Reply YES and I'll
call you personally. - [Agent]
```

**Day 4 of Inactivity:**

**Email:**
```
Subject: "[Name], you're missing out!"

Hi [Name],

You started your free trial 5 days ago, but you haven't
used any benefits yet. Let me help!

Here's what you can do TODAY:
1. Book a telehealth session (takes 2 min)
2. Check your Rx discounts (see pharmacy savings)
3. Share with your family (they can use it too)

I've made it easy - just click below and I'll walk you through:

[Schedule 10-Min Call With Me]

Or just reply to this email with questions.

Don't let your trial go to waste!

- [Agent Name]
[Direct Phone Number]
```

**Day 6 of Trial (Final Push):**

**Phone Call Attempt:**
- Personalized voicemail if no answer
- Offer to extend trial by 3 days
- "I really want you to experience the value"

**SMS:**
```
[Name], your trial ends in 24 hours. Let's make sure you
tried everything! I extended it 3 days just for you.
Book telehealth now: [link]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Proactive intervention
- Personalized approach
- Demonstrates value through usage
- Trial extension removes pressure
- Human touch builds trust

### Tactic 6: "The Upsell Ladder"

**For Existing Customers (Post-Conversion)**

**Month 1-3: Satisfaction & Engagement**
- Focus: Ensure usage, collect feedback, build loyalty
- No upsell attempts

**Month 4: Soft Upsell**

**Trigger:** Customer has used telehealth 2+ times

**Email:**
```
Subject: "You're using telehealth a lot! Have you considered upgrading?"

Hi [Name],

I noticed you've had 3 telehealth sessions this month.
That's great! Your family is really using the benefits.

Quick question: Did you know that if you upgrade to the
Advanced plan, you'd also get:
- Monthly nutrition consultations
- Monthly mental health support
- $2,000 funeral assistance
- $900 family remittance support if something happens

And it's only $2 more per month ($9.99 vs $7.99).

Since you're already using telehealth regularly, these
additional benefits would be perfect for your family.

Upgrade now (just $2/mo more) →

[Upgrade Button]

P.S. Cancel anytime if it's not right for you.
```

**Why It Works:**
- Behavior-based trigger
- Incremental upgrade (small price difference)
- Demonstrates value-add
- Low-risk proposition
- Timing: After positive experience
